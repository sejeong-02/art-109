            <h3>Sweet Tubatu</h3>
            <p>The project involved the development and creative merchandising of original characters inspired by the K-pop band Tomorrow by Together. Each character was designed with distinct color and facial features, creating dynamics in the set as a whole with various product items. I aimed to use the colors and aesthetics that evoke the innocence of childhood, which inspired the name of the project. From concept to completion, I managed every stage of the production, including planning, design, manufacturing, and shipping. The final product was designed to provide buyers with both visual delight and a satisfying tactile experience.</p>

            <p>The project was a precursor of Sweet Tubatu and also focused on the development and creative merchandising of original characters inspired by the K-pop band Tomorrow by Together. Each character featured distinct animal traits and facial expressions, adding variety and charm to a set of plushies. Beyond the plushies, I expanded the merchandise line by creating photocard frames, photocard holder keychains, and hand fans. This diverse range of items provided buyers with more options and a fun, engaging shopping experience. This project played an important role in improving my skills in creative management and end-to-end project execution. Working as the artist, designer, and project manager allowed me to view the user experience from the buyer’s perspective, further enhancing the quality and appeal of the products.

            <p>The project focused on character and merchandise design, incorporating elements of guitar motifs and pop-culture aesthetics. Inspired by the K-pop group Tomorrow by Together, each of the five characters was distinctly designed with unique facial features and personalities, reflected in the pose and color of their guitar. From product design to packaging, the goal was to deliver a cohesive and enjoyable experience for buyers, blending visual storytelling with engaging, high-quality merchandise.

            <p>COZISOOP is a project that combines original character development, social media marketing, and merchandising. With its vibrant and playful concepts, the project reflects my passion for visual aesthetics, particularly through the depiction of animals as primary characters.

              Using animals allows me to break free from stereotypes often associated with human characters, fostering a sense of affection, friendliness, and comfort that resonates universally with viewers. Through the creation of illustrations and physical items, I aimed to craft a playful and interactive experience that engages and delights people across different mediums.

            <h3>Happy Christmas          </h3>
            <p>This 3D animation focuses on the theme of Christmas, featuring stylized 3D assets that evoke the festive spirit. To amplify the celebratory atmosphere, I incorporated a dynamic snow-covered background and a variety of Christmas-themed elements. The character's engaging interaction with the camera draws viewers into the scene, fostering a sense of immersion and evoking audience reactions. The integration of sound further enhances the narrative, creating a seamless and engaging audiovisual experience.
